I used app shopper website to alert me when certain iPad apps go on sale, and Art Rage finally went on sale. Art Rage tries harder to emulate physical media in texture, blending and behavior. Since the taking the reins of our new ERP software deployment I stopped staying up late and drawing. So I did what started me drawing in the first place, downloading a new app and drawing what is in front of me.
