I made the decision to sign up for an online program to help assist  me with my drawing path. While searching for a good curriculum for  myself I ran across the Atelier program. Unfortunately, the closest ones  are still 3+ hours away. In a moment of desperation I searched for  online Atelier and found Watt’s Atelier from California. The online  program had only been launched a few months prior, and I found myself  nodding my head way too much when the director spoke about the  curriculum purpose and path of his Atelier.

I found the necessary supply list of pencils and newsprint, placed my  order at dickblick and began counting the days until I could start.  Last night I watched the introductory videos and today is my first day  doing the program. One thing I can comment on is how much longer it took  me to sharpen my pencil and keep it properly shaped. My pencil looks  less like a pencil and more like a tiny jousting lance. Also, I am not  comfortable with the seemly massive 18″ x 24″ newsprint, but at least  it’s cheap.

Hopefully as the weeks, months and years pass there will be a  significant increase in my quality of work. For now I am chugging out  the fundamentals, hoping to build a big and solid foundation for the  rest of my art career.
