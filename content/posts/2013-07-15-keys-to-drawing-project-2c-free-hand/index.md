I skipped exercise 2a and 2b which were copying a famous drawing and  then adapting that style to a new drawing. I will hopefully come back to  it. Today I had been reading about figure drawing, and so I was excited  to try my had at gesture drawings. Each figure was drawn for 60  seconds. I was quickly humbled when I felt myself scrambling and  confused. I actually paused the exercise to watch a YouTube video of  someone else doing gesture drawings. I don’t know if it helped.

Next exercise was a 5 minute burn in which I drew what was in front of  me. I am surrounded by various tablets and cups with partials of coffee.
