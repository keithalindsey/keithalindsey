We went to San Angelo this weekend so I was away from my usual Cont√© charcoal and newsprint. I brought my markers, pens and little sketchbook and experimented with them. I learned a lot about how to use them and blend them. I enjoyed using them so much I started calculating the cost for Copic markers if I ever decided to do color.
