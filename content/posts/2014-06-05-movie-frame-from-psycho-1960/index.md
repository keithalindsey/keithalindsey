Finished the painting from a frame of Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) in Procreate on iPad. This took much longer than it should have, and I found out that I should have drawn the house with more detail before painting. I ended redoing the windows again and again because the perspective was off, and the porch still doesn't look right.
