Today was my first 5am drawing session. It was 27 degrees outside so I had the space heater going full blast since my studio still doubles as a garage. Overall it went well and I actually felt better about it than many night sessions I've had. I will continue to use the morning sessions for grinding simple skills, and at night I will work on more difficult topics.
